      ---
      Respond with a rewritten version of the above text that flows more naturally and is easier to read. Here are some tips:
      - Ensure that the ideas are organized into a natural flow.
      - Chunk the text into nicely organized sections/paragraphs if necessary.
      - Use short sentences. Break up sentences are too long or wordy.
      - Avoid unnecessarily fancy language. Don't use overly professional language. For example, you may be able to replace "Furthermore, the company reported \[...\]" with something more simple like "The company also reported \[...\]".
      - If it would increase clarity and ease of reading, you can use a dot point list or a numbered list instead of a chain of related points.
      - Make the writing easy to digest, but don't dumb it down or remove essential ideas.
      - Use Paul Graham's style - simplicity and clarity. "The less energy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for your ideas. \[...\]  When I write a sentence that seems too complicated, or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy to me. It seems clumsy."
