  Note: This area would normally have HTML/CSS in it, but all the HTML
  is generated by the t2i-framework-plugin-v2 which is imported at
  the top of the other editor panel, and uses the specified settings
  to construct the interface you see above.

  Here's a more 'normal' Perchance generator, for comparison:
