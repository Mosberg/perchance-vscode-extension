  <p>I made this framework thing as an experiment, and I've used it to make these generators:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://perchance.org/ai-character-generator#edit" target="_blank"
        >https://perchance.org/ai-character-generator#edit</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://perchance.org/ai-pokemon-generator#edit" target="_blank"
        >https://perchance.org/ai-pokemon-generator#edit</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator#edit" target="_blank"
        >https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator#edit</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      and a few others, mainly to separate the galleries and chats out into different niches, since
      most have the same styles
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You're of course welcome to use it yourself to make your own image generators.
    <b
      >Just fork one of the above generators and customize it according to the comments I've added
      in the code</b
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm still working on this, but I'll make sure to keep all changes backwards-compatible so you
    can use it if you want to.
  </p>
  <p>If there are any breaking changes, then I'll put them in t2i-framework-plugin-v3.</p>
  <p>
    Note: This is v2 and it's not backwards-compatible with v1. If you want to port your v1
    generator to v2, then start with a duplicate of one of the generators that's linked above and
    make the necessary changes to align it with your original v1 version.
